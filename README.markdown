Please use the code for learning and not for evil ;)

## About the code

* The code has been tested with gcc. It also works with mingw with few exceptions (like when _unlocked functions are used).
* It may not be the best solution algorithmically because I'm not the best coder around. It has been accepted by the holy SPOJ server, so don't complain :P
